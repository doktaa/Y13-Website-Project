							<p class="satext">
								During the course of 2014, the Year 13 Electronics students have been working on a school-funded project to create a product for their stakeholders, staff in the GDC PE Department.
								Our project can be described as a mobile camera mount system that houses a GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition sports/outdoors camera. The mount will be able to travel along 2 steel wires installed
								in the new gym, suspended a few metres into the air. Within the mount, the camera will be able to be controlled from the ground via remote technology to spin 360 degrees for unlimited motion
								capture. The remote will also allow the mount to travel across the wires from one end of the new gym to the other.

								When the project first started, we had to plan out what we were going to be working on for the next few months, assign roles to team members, and research pieces and components that
								we were going to use in our product. We also had to sketch brief models of how our system was going to work for future development. This is one of the great aspects of the Electronics
								course as it teaches teamwork, time management and planning/research skills on a large scale.

								After designing different concepts for our system during the initial stages, our task was to weigh the pros and cons of each system and make a final joined decision as to which system
								would benefit us the most and work at the highest standard for our stakeholder's needs. The electronics course incorporates a lot of critical decision making procedures such as this throughout 
								everything a student does. Following the decision of which system we were going to use, we had to start modelling them in CAD software such as Kreo and Google Sketchup. It incorporates critical
								thinking and problem solving because modifications will always have to be made after testing to see if the design works. Eventually, after fixing all the problems, we would end up with a final
								working product with no problems.

								After designing the model in 3D software, the files are sent to a 3D printer to be created and eventually assembled. Many parts had to be 
								reprinted due to us having to constantly improve our design and add little modifications to make the product better. The video below
								shows the final prototype being demonstrated to our stakeholder in our makeshift replica environment of the new gym setup.
