						<h2 class="heading2">Overview</h2>
						<p class="homeintro">
							The 'Digital Technologies: Electronics' course is one of the various subjects being offered part of the Technology faculty at Glendowie College. 
							Throughout the year, students will learn to work with various electrical components, program those components and create their own projects, 
							while learning how the components interact with each other in a circuit. These electrical components range from simple PICAXE microcontrollers, DC motors, 
							LED lights and sound emitters to more advanced components which students work with later in the year which include components such as ultrasonic sensors, QTI sensors, radio frequency transmitters, 
							receivers and servo motors. Students get the chance to create projects using their own ideas and designs, meaning that although there are basic rules you have to follow while making the project, 
							a majority of it comes down to your own creativity and knowledge.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="homeintro">
							A good aspect of this course is that it teaches and incorporates useful and important morals to students due to the nature of how the course is structured. 
							Having students create projects based on their own ideas and creativity with no strict guidelines to follow lets them think and analyse how to best approach a problem and solve it. 
							Time management is also an important quality that students need to develop as projects span across multiple weeks, sometimes months for completion so students will have to create key 
							review points and manage their time so they're able to keep up to date with their project and not fall behind by deadlines. It's a great hands-on subject for students who like practical work 
							as opposed to theory work as it allows students to really get into the thick of things while being fun at the same time.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="homeintro">				
							As students progress through the years in this subject from Year 9 to Year 13, they acquire a multitude of useful skills which will be of great use to them in future situations. Students learn to work
							independently and in groups, combining different ideas with fellow classmates and fine tuning them to create a combined outcome. Working in groups allows students to work together and develop skills
							such as role assignments, time management and social interactions. Having access to resources such as 'Google Documents' allow group projects to be easily done as multiple students can edit a document
							in real time together, while having a document stored on Google Drive which is shareable with other members of the projcet.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="homeintro">
							Overall, the 'Digital Technologies: Electronics' course is a great option for students interested in working with modern technology, looking to explore into the technological branch or 
							electrical engineering in the future. It offers great ways to apply knowledge and skills about electronics into practical situations and grants great satisfaction when you create something that works.
